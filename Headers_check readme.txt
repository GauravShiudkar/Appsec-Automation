üõ†Ô∏è How it works
The script prompts the user for the scan type: Pre-login or Post-login.
For pre-login, it fetches headers for given URLs.
For post-login, it uses a browser to navigate the logged-in session and capture internal links.
Checks the following HTTP headers:
Strict-Transport-Security
Content-Security-Policy
X-Content-Type-Options
Access-Control-Allow-Origin
X-Frame-Options
X-XSS-Protection
Detects missing or misconfigured headers based on simple rules.
Suggests correct values for headers in the last column of the Excel file.
Color-codes header values in Excel:
Green = OK
Yellow = Misconfigured
Red = Missing

‚úÖ Output
headers_report.xlsx
Columns: URL, each HTTP header, Suggested Correct Values
Misconfigured/missing headers are highlighted in color
